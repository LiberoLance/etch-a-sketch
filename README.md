# etch-a-sketch
This will be my first free form project in the foundations course, it is essentially a basic implementation of a cross between an etch-a-sketch and a sketchpad.
The implementation is basically up to me. I want to take a disciplined approach and really try the think first code last approach, making sure I'm planning things out.
